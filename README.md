### _My Personal Dotfiles<br>(and the means to manage them)_

</div>

> These are my .dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine. My .dotfiles are my best friends. They are my life. I must master them as I must master my life. My .dotfiles, without me, are useless. Without my .dotfiles, I am useless. I must execute my .dotfiles true. I must use them straighter than my enemy who is trying to hack me. I must hack him before he hacks me ... and I will ...

## [Overview](#top) üìë

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD026 --->
### Welcome to yet another fucking dotfile repository!

These are the very first files I drop onto any machine I set up ‚Äî bare metal or virtual, it doesn‚Äôt matter. Why? Because they guarantee my environment feels just right, no matter where I am. Inside you‚Äôll find slick aliases, custom functions, completions, and plenty more.

Keeping everything running smooth is a lightweight command-line utility written in Python. It takes inspiration from the big-name environment managers, but skips the bloat (and yes, you even get to pick your own prompt style!).

## [Installation](#top) üìÇ

### Step 1 - Clone this Repository

Clone this repo to a directory anywhere under your user's home directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ragdata/.dotfiles.git
```

### Step 2 - Create Virtual Environment

(This only needs to be done once - once complete you can skip this step and go straight to step 3.  And yes, I'm sorry - you need to create the virtual environment exactly as shown because it is referenced in the makefile)

```shell
cd ~
python3 -m venv ~/.venv/dotenv
```

### Step 3 - Activate Virtual Environment

```shell
source ~/.venv/dotenv/bin/activate
```

Once `.dotfiles` is installed, an alias will automatically load allowing you to activate the virtual environment using the following command:

```shell
dotenv
```

To deactivate the virtual environment, use the `deactivate` command as usual.

### Step 4 - Run the Installer

```shell
cd .dotfiles
make install
source ~/.bashrc
```

And that's it, you're ready to go!

<!-- ## [Tests](#top) üèè

There are a bunch of tests available for the package.  You don't NEED to run them manually as a GitHub Actions Workflow makes sure everything is tested as it's committed - but just in case you WANT to, it's all configured via the `Makefile` in the project root.

The following commands are used to initiate tests manually:

```shell
# Install test dependencies
make install-test-deps

# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test categories
make test-unit
make test-integration
make test-edge-cases

# Run with coverage report
make test-coverage

# Lint and format code
make lint
make format

# Clean up test artifacts
make clean

# Run tests in parallel
pytest tests/ -n auto

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_install.py -v

# Run tests matching pattern
pytest tests/ -k "test_install" -v

# Run slow tests only
pytest tests/ -m "slow" -v
```
